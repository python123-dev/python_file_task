List Comprehension

1.Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7

2.Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have a 3 in them

3.Count the number of spaces in a string

4.Create a list of all the consonants in the string 
“Yellow Yaks like yelling and yawning and yesturday they yodled while eating yuky yams”

5.Get the index and the value as a tuple for items in the list
 “hi”, 4, 8.99, ‘apple’, (‘t,b’,’n’). Result would look like (index, value), (index, value)

6.Find the common numbers in two lists (without using a tuple or set)
 list_a = 1, 2, 3, 4, list_b = 2, 3, 4, 5

7.Get only the numbers in a sentence like 
‘In 1984 there were 13 instances of a protest with over 1000 people attending’

8.Given numbers = range(20), produce a list containing the word ‘even’ if a number in the numbers is even, 
and the word ‘odd’ if the number is odd. Result would look like ‘odd’,’odd’, ‘even’

9.Produce a list of tuples consisting of only the matching numbers in these 
lists list_a = 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, list_b = 2, 7, 1, 12. Result would look like (4,4), (12,12)

10.Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters

11.Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers 
from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9)


Dict Comprehension

1.Convert Two Lists into a Dictionary
Task: Given keys = ['a', 'b', 'c'] and values = [1, 2, 3], create a dictionary using dict comprehension.

2.Invert a Dictionary
Task: Given a dictionary, swap its keys and values.
original = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
Output = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}

3.Count Occurrences of Characters in a Word
Task: Given a string, create a dictionary with character counts.
word = "banana"
Output: {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}

4.Merge Two Dictionaries (add values if keys match)
Task: Combine two dictionaries by adding values for common keys.
d1 = {'a': 5, 'b': 3}
d2 = {'a': 2, 'b': 7, 'c': 4}
Output: {'a': 7, 'b': 10, 'c': 4}



Map Filter Reduce

Map:
1. Square Each Number in a List
2. Convert a List of Strings to Uppercase
3. Add Two Lists Element-Wise
4.list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  list2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
  list3 = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
  output=[111,222,333,444,555]



Filter:
1. Filter Even Numbers from a List
2. Filter a list of Words with Length > 4
3. Filter Out Empty Strings
4. filter prime nums from a list

Reduce:
1.Concatenate a List of Strings using reduce
2. Find the maximum value from a list


Time

1. calculate the time required to complete a process
2.Display current time every second
3.Print the current year and month
4.Create a simple stopwatch


Datetime
1.current time
2.Days until a specific date
3.convert a user input from yyyy-mm-dd to dd-mm-yy

Random
Task: Random Data Generator for Testing
Description:
Create a script that generates fake data for 10 users. Each user should have:

A random full name

A random age between 18 and 60

A random 10-digit phone number

A random email based on their name

Store the data in a nested dictionary.



OS Module:
1.create a file directory
2.Using Os module find the file exists or not
3.Merge two file paths
