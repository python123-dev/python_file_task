Class and Object:

1.Define a Student Class
Task:
Create a Student class with attributes: name, roll_no, and marks. 
Create two student objects and print their details.

2.Calculate Average
Task:
Add a method get_grade() that returns the grade based on marks:

Above 90: A

80-90: B

Below 80: C

3.Class Method vs Instance Method
Task:
Create a class Laptop with:

class variable brand

instance variable price
Add a class method to change the brand for all objects.

4. Use Dunder/magic method to compare two objects.

5. Create a class with static method.


Inheritance

1. Basic Inheritance
Create a Vehicle class with a method start().

Inherit it in a Car class and add a drive() method.

Create an object of Car and call both methods.

2. Constructor Overriding
Create a Person class with __init__ taking name and age.

Create an Employee class that inherits Person and also takes employee ID.

Show how super() is used.

3. Method Overriding
Create a Shape class with method area().

Create a Square class that overrides area().

4. Multilevel Inheritance
LivingBeing → Animal → Dog

Add unique methods in each and access all from Dog.

5. Multiple Inheritance
Flyer class with method fly()

Swimmer class with method swim()

Duck class inherits both and has its own quack() method.

6. Using super() in methods (not just __init__)
Create a base class with a method and override it in the child.

In the child, use super() to call the parent method before extending it.


Polymorphism:

1.write a polymorphic function to add two integers and to add two strings

2.What is method overriding show it with an example?

3.Write a function that accepts any shape object and prints its area?

4. Shape Area
Define two classes Rectangle and Triangle.
Both should have a method area() which returns the area of the shape.
Write a function print_area(shape) to display the area.

5.Animal Sounds
Create three classes: Dog, Cat, and Cow. Each class should have a method speak() that prints their respective sounds.
Requirement: Call the speak() method using a loop.


Abstraction:

1. Abstract Shape Class
Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area().
Then create two child classes: Circle and Rectangle, and implement the area() method in both.

2.Abstract Payment System
Create an abstract class Payment with an abstract method pay(amount).
Create classes CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment that implement the payment logic.

3.Abstract Animal Sound
Create an abstract class Animal with an abstract method make_sound().
Create classes Dog, Cat, and Cow that implement make_sound() accordingly.
